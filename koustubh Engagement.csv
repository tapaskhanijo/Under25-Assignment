He stays in the department of commerce but where was it??</p><blockquote>I had never been to my college before, I didn't know a single office or class in there.

Jumpcut to the lockdown! üß±
Honestly saying I was very happy that I didn't have to go anymore cause I was already¬†<strong>Interning with Under 25.</strong>
Not going to college meant I¬†<strong>get 2-3 extra hours</strong>¬†in a day! WOOHOOL
That's when I had¬†<strong>full control of my schedule¬†</strong>and I started mapping out my daysüåª
I came up with this theory which was is the¬† ""Zero Delay policy""</p>
<p><img src=""https://under25app.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2021-10-27_175607.max-1440x900.png"" alt="""" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zero Delay Policy: Following time to the T without delaying any task.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:<strong>¬†If I had to do something at 2 PM I have to start sharp at 2.
Not 2:03 or 2:05, sharp at 2 as¬†</strong><em>now I don't have to wait for the lift or maybe find parking?</em></strong></p>

<p>And this is my favourite NOT GET STUCK IN TRAFIC!</p>

This is one way of celebrating such RCs &amp; sending them all the love.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>What does it mean to get a mission badge?üèÜ</h3><p>It means you're on the right path. You over deliver and all you have to do is keep at it. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>What do these badges unlock?üéÅ</h3><p>A certain number of mission badges will unlock special dedicated surprises in the fellowship. <em>More on this very soon!</em></p><p><br></p><h3>How many people get mission badges per mission? üî¢</h3><p>There is no certainty on the number. It depends on the impact of the mission &amp; participation of RCs. Some missions might reward 10 badges while some might not have any.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>What if I don't get a mission badge will I not unlock things?üåª</h3><p><br></p><p>Nothing like that, if a mission had a goal &amp; you met the criteria you will definitely be rewarded. Mission badges are like additional benefits and a flex for exceptional performance. </p><p><br></p><p>There are high chances that you might not get it in every mission but have a positive approach &amp; keep at it cause there is a lot left to unlock!</p><p><br></p><h3>All the best my lovely RC's!üéñ</h3><p><br></p><p><br></p><br><br><br><br>",REACH NOW ADDED,215,88,0,OUTSIDE SHARE COUNTER NOW ADDED,41,48,0,0,,,,,,,,TO BE ADDED,,TO BE ADDED

That's what this is all about.</p><p><br></p><p>If you wake up every single day &amp; put your head down and keep doing, magic comes by. </p><p><br></p><p>I smiled, like I do only because I'm happy for the Koustubh in January 2022, who would have lost his mind over this &amp; I'm so glad this happened but for now, I'm looking for more smiles, growth &amp; curiosities.</p><p><br></p><h3>I'm forever grateful &amp; this one is for all of you.
